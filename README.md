# Pack Your Labs

This is a collection of labs I'm doing on the field. Being a consultant is somehow being a nomad
and I can't rely on things that might fail, like mobile internet. Thus my labs are always with me...
and now I'm sharing them with you.

The principle is simple: if it doesn't fit in my backpack, doesn't worth doing.

## What You Will Need

A nice piece of hardware and Ansible.

## How To Provision The Labs

Just follow the lab's README file, each one contains everything you'll need to run the labs locally.
