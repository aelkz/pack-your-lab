# Kickstart Files

For a complete automated installation, you can use the Anaconda's Kickstart. The easiest way is
to provide a second disk labeled `OEMDRV`.

The file `conf/ks.cfg` is very close to the one I use. In case you don't want to modify it, just
install your CentOS/Red Hat and look for the kickstart file on the `/root/` folder.

The `build.sh` script will create the `iso` image for you.
